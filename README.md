# TempBodge

Very simple Raspberry Pi temperature monitor with a barebones frontend

### Deploying
This is intended to be used as a base for developing your own temperature
station/frontend combination. Change the secrets, urls and all that to
fit your use case and use Apache or Nginx to point to the port 10990.
